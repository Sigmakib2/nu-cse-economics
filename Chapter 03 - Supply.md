## What is the law of supply

**Description:** Law of supply depicts the producer behavior at the time of changes in the prices of goods and services. When the price of a good rises, the supplier increases the supply in order to earn a profit because of higher prices.

The above diagram shows the supply curve that is upward sloping (positive relation between the price and the quantity supplied). When the price of the good was at P3, suppliers were supplying Q3 quantity. As the price starts rising, the quantity supplied also starts rising.
### KEY TAKEAWAYS

- The law of supply says that a higher price will lead producers to supply a higher quantity to the market.
- Because businesses seek to increase revenue, when they expect to receive a higher price for something, they will produce more of it.
- Meanwhile, if prices fall, suppliers are disincentivized from producing as much.
- Supply in a market can be depicted as an upward-sloping supply curve that shows how the quantity supplied will respond to various prices over a period of time.
- Together with demand, the law of supply forms half of the law of supply and demand.
## Determinants of supply

The quantity of a good or service that producers are willing to supply in a market is influenced by various factors. These factors, known as determinants of supply, can affect the entire supply curve for a particular product. Here are some key determinants of supply:

1. **Price of the Good or Service:** As mentioned in the law of supply, there is a positive relationship between the price of a good or service and the quantity supplied. An increase in price generally leads to an increase in quantity supplied, assuming other factors remain constant.
    
2. **Cost of Production:** The cost of producing a good or service is a critical determinant. If the cost of production increases, producers may be less willing to supply the good at the existing market price, potentially leading to a decrease in supply.
    
3. **Technology:** Advances in technology can impact production processes, making them more efficient and cost-effective. Improved technology often leads to an increase in supply as producers can now produce more output with the same amount of resources.
    
4. **Factor Inputs (Resources):** The availability and cost of factors of production, such as labor, raw materials, and capital, can significantly affect supply. If there is a shortage or increase in the cost of these inputs, it may reduce the quantity that producers are willing to supply.
    
5. **Number of Sellers:** The number of producers or sellers in a market can influence supply. More sellers entering a market can increase overall supply, while a decrease in the number of sellers may reduce supply.
    
6. **Expectations of Future Prices:** Producers' expectations about future prices can influence their current supply decisions. If producers anticipate that the price of a good will increase in the future, they may reduce current supply to take advantage of higher prices later.
    
7. **Government Policies:** Various government policies, such as taxes, subsidies, and regulations, can impact the cost of production and influence supply. For example, a subsidy to producers may encourage higher levels of production.
    
8. **Natural Disasters and Environmental Factors:** Unforeseen events, such as natural disasters, can disrupt production and supply chains. Environmental factors, like weather conditions, can also impact agricultural output.
    
9. **Changes in the Prices of Related Goods:** The prices of goods that are substitutes or complements can influence supply. For example, if the price of a substitute for a good increases, producers may shift their resources toward the production of that good, reducing supply in the original market.
    
These determinants interact to shape the supply curve for a particular good or service, illustrating how changes in these factors can lead to shifts in the overall supply. It's important to note that these determinants are interrelated, and changes in one can affect others.
