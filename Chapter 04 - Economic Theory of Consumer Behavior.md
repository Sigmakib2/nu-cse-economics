## What is consumer behavior?

Consumer behavior is the actions and decisions that people or households make when they choose, buy, use, and dispose of a product or service. Many psychological, sociological, and cultural elements play a role in how consumers engage with the market.

It is a multi-stage process that involves identifying problems, collecting data, exploring options, making a decision to buy, and evaluating the experience afterward. Consumers may be impacted during these stages by things including personal views and values, social conventions, marketing campaigns, product features, and environmental conditions.

Understanding consumer behavior is essential for businesses to create marketing plans that work and to supply goods and services that satisfy customers’ wants and needs. To see trends and patterns, forecast demand, and make wise choices regarding product design, price, promotion, and distribution, marketers must analyze and understand data on customer behavior.
## What Is the Consumption Function?

The term consumption function refers to an economic formula that represents the functional relationship between total consumption and [gross national income (GNI)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gross-national-income-gni.asp). The consumption function was introduced by British economist [John Maynard Keynes](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/john_maynard_keynes.asp), who argued the function could be used to track and predict total aggregate consumption expenditures. It is a valuable tool that can be used by economists and other leaders to understand the economic cycle and help them make key decisions about investments as well as monetary and fiscal policy.  

- The consumption function is an economic formula that measures the relationship between income and total consumption of goods and services in the economy.
- The consumption function was introduced by John Maynard Keynes.
- Keynes argued that the consumption function could track and predict total aggregate consumption spending.
- Economists and leaders can use the consumption function to make important economic and investment decisions.
- Other economists have come up with variations of the consumption function over time, including those developed by Franco Modigliani and Milton Friedman.
### Calculating the Consumption Function

The consumption function is represented as:

**C = A + MD**

where:
C=consumer spending
A=autonomous consumption
M=marginal propensity to consume
D=real disposable income​

## What Is Marginal Utility?

Marginal [utility](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/utility.asp) is the added satisfaction that a consumer gets from having one more unit of a good or service. The concept of marginal utility is used by economists to determine how much of an item consumers are willing to purchase.

Positive marginal utility occurs when the consumption of an additional item increases the total utility. On the other hand, negative marginal utility occurs when the consumption of one more unit decreases the overall utility.

- Marginal utility is the added satisfaction a consumer gets from having one more unit of a good or service.
- The concept of marginal utility is used by economists to determine how much of an item consumers are willing to purchase.
- The law of diminishing marginal utility is often used to justify progressive taxes.
- Marginal utility can be positive, zero, or negative.
## What Is Total Utility?

Total utility is the aggregate amount of satisfaction or fulfillment that a consumer receives through the consumption of a specific good or service. Total utility is often compared to [marginal utility](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marginalutility.asp), which is the satisfaction a consumer receives from consuming one additional unit of a good or service. Total utility helps economists understand the demand for goods and services.

- Total utility is the aggregate summation of satisfaction or fulfillment that a consumer receives through the consumption of goods or services.
- Economists seek to quantify utility and total utility using utils.
- To best understand total utility, one should understand the Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility, which states that as more of a single good or service is consumed, the additional satisfaction, referred to as marginal utility, drops.
- Total utility is a core concept studied when seeking to analyze consumer behaviors.
- In general, economic theories believe that consumer actions are usually based on the goal of total utility maximization, which leads to purchasing units perceived to have the greatest utility satisfaction.

## Total Utility vs Marginal Utility

The following table will help students understand the significant points of difference between total utility and marginal utility.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Total utility**|**Marginal utility**|
|**What does it mean?**|   |
|It is the aggregate of satisfaction that a consumer derives from the consumption of any particular goods or services.|It is the amount of satisfaction derived by a consumer by additional consumption of a unit of any particular goods or services.|
|**Rate of increase**|   |
|Total utility rises as more consumption is done.|Marginal utility diminishes with an increase in total utility.|
|**Result**|   |
|It suffers from diminishing returns.|Marginal utility reduces with the consumption of each additional unit.|

## What Is the Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility?

The law of diminishing marginal utility states that all else equal, as consumption increases, the marginal utility derived from each additional unit declines.

In simple terms, the law of diminishing marginal utility means that the more of an item that you use or consume, the less satisfaction you get from each additional unit consumed or used.

- The law of diminishing marginal utility says that the marginal utility from each additional unit declines as consumption increases.1
- The marginal utility can decline into negative utility, as it may become entirely unfavorable to consume another unit of any product.
- The marginal utility may decrease into negative utility, as it may become entirely unfavorable to consume another unit of any product.
## What Is the Law of Diminishing Marginal Returns?

The law of diminishing marginal returns is a theory in economics that predicts that after some optimal level of capacity is reached, adding an additional factor of production will actually result in smaller increases in output.

For example, a factory employs workers to manufacture its products, and, at some point, the company operates at an optimal level. With all other production factors constant, adding additional workers beyond this optimal level will result in less efficient operations.

- The law of diminishing marginal returns states that adding an additional factor of production results in smaller increases in output. 
- After some optimal level of capacity utilization, the addition of any larger amounts of a factor of production will inevitably yield decreased per-unit incremental returns.
- For example, if a factory employs workers to manufacture its products, at some point, the company will operate at an optimal level; with all other production factors constant, adding additional workers beyond this optimal level will result in less efficient operations.
