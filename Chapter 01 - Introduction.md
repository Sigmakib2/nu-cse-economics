## What is Economics?

Economics is aÂ social science that focuses on the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, and analyses the choices that individuals, businesses, governments, and nations make to allocate resources.

Economics can be broadly categorized into two main branches:

1. **Microeconomics:** This branch focuses on the behavior of individual agents, such as households, firms, and industries. Microeconomics examines how these entities make decisions regarding the allocation of resources, pricing of goods and services, and the interactions in specific markets.

2. **Macroeconomics:** This branch looks at the broader aspects of the economy, such as aggregate output, unemployment, inflation, and overall economic growth. Macroeconomics analyses the performance and behaviour of the economy as a whole and considers factors like government policies, international trade, and monetary systems.
