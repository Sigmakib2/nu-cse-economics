## What is demand

In economics, demand refers to the quantity of a good or service that consumers are willing and able to buy at various prices during a particular period of time. It represents the relationship between the price of a product and the quantity of that product that consumers are willing to purchase. The law of demand, a fundamental principle in economics, states that, all else being equal, as the price of a good or service decreases, the quantity demanded increases, and vice versa.

### The law of demand

The law of demand is a fundamental principle in economics that describes the relationship between the price of a good or service and the quantity demanded by consumers. The law of demand can be summarized with the following statement:

The law of demand states that the quantity purchased varies inversely with price. In other words, the higher the price, the lower the quantity demanded.

## **Demand Function?**

A demand function is a mathematical function describing the relationship between a variable, like the demand of quantity, and various factors determining the demand. The purpose of this function is to analyze the behavior of consumers in a market and to help firms make pricing decisions.

## Why demand curve is downward sloping?

The demand curve is downward-sloping due to the law of demand, which states that, all else being equal, as the price of a good or service decreases, the quantity demanded for that good or service increases, and as the price increases, the quantity demanded decreases.

There are a few reasons why this negative relationship between price and quantity demanded exists:

1. **Substitution Effect:** When the price of a good decreases, it becomes relatively less expensive compared to other goods. Consumers often respond to this by substituting the now relatively cheaper good for other goods, leading to an increase in the quantity demanded.
    
2. **Income Effect:** A decrease in the price of a good effectively increases consumers' real income, allowing them to purchase more of the good with the same amount of money. Conversely, an increase in price reduces real income, leading to a decrease in the quantity demanded.
    
3. **Diminishing Marginal Utility:** The law of diminishing marginal utility suggests that as consumers consume more units of a good, the additional satisfaction or utility derived from each additional unit diminishes. Therefore, consumers are willing to pay a higher price for the first unit (which provides the highest level of satisfaction) and less for subsequent units.
    
Graphically, when you plot these relationships on a demand curve, you observe a negative slope. The downward-sloping demand curve is a fundamental concept in microeconomics and is crucial for understanding consumer behavior and market dynamics. It serves as a foundational principle in the analysis of supply and demand in a market economy.

## **Determinants of Demand / factors determining the demand**

There are many determinants of demand, but the top five determinants of demand are as follows: 

**Product cost:** Demand of the product changes as per the change in the price of the commodity. People deciding to buy a product remain constant only if all the factors related to it remain unchanged.

**The income of the consumers:** When the income increases, the number of goods demanded also increases. Likewise, if the income decreases, the demand also decreases.

**Costs of related goods and services:** For a complimentary product, an increase in the cost of one commodity will decrease the demand for a complimentary product. Example: An increase in the rate of bread will decrease the demand for butter. Similarly, an increase in the rate of one commodity will generate the demand for a substitute product to increase. Example: Increase in the cost of tea will raise the demand for coffee and therefore, decrease the demand for tea.

**Consumer expectation:** High expectation of income or expectation in the increase in price of a good also leads to an increase in demand. Similarly, low expectation of income or low pricing of goods will decrease the demand.

**Buyers in the market:** If the number of buyers for a commodity are more or less, then there will be a shift in demand.

## Movement along Demand Curve and Shift in Demand Curve

### **Movement along the demand curve**

Movement along the demand curve refers to a change in the quantity demanded of a good or service as its price changes, while all other factors affecting demand remain constant. This is represented by a movement along the demand curve itself, as shown in the following graph:

![](/images/Movement-along-the-Demand-Curve-copy.webp)
In this graph, the demand curve shows the relationship between the price of a good (P) and the quantity demanded (Q). As the price of the good increases, the quantity demanded decreases, and vice versa. This inverse relationship is represented by the downward slope of the demand curve.

Movement along the demand curve can occur for a variety of reasons, such as:

- **Changes in consumer income:** If consumers' incomes increase, they will generally be willing to buy more of a good at any given price. This will cause the demand curve to shift to the right.
    
- **Changes in consumer tastes and preferences:** If consumers' tastes and preferences change, this can also cause the demand curve to shift. For example, if consumers become more health-conscious, they may demand less of a good that is perceived as unhealthy.
    
- **Changes in the prices of substitutes:** If the prices of substitutes change, this can also cause the demand curve for a good to shift. For example, if the price of butter increases, the demand for margarine may increase.
    
- **Changes in expectations:** If consumers expect the price of a good to increase in the future, they may be more likely to buy the good today. This will cause the demand curve to shift to the right.
    
### **Shift in the demand curve**

A shift in the demand curve occurs when there is a change in the quantity demanded at every given price, due to a change in one or more factors other than the price of the good. For example, if consumers' incomes increase, this will cause the demand curve to shift to the right.

As you can see in the graph, the demand curve has shifted to the right. This means that at every given price, consumers are now willing to buy more of the good.

Here are some of the factors that can cause a shift in the demand curve:

- Changes in consumer income
- Changes in consumer tastes and preferences
- Changes in the prices of substitutes
- Changes in the prices of complements
- Changes in expectations
- Changes in population size
- Changes in technology
